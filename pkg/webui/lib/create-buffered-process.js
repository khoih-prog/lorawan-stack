/**
 * `createBufferedProcess` creates a buffered event ingest to combine and
 * process multiple payloads at once that can otherwise cause lags when
 * processed individually in rapid succession.
 *
 * @param {Function} process - The action to be performed on the combined
 * payloads before the buffer is cleared.
 * @param {number} maxItems - The maximum number of items that the buffer can
 * hold before it will dispatch, regardless of the delay. Default is 20.
 * @param {number} delay - The delay in ms that the buffer will wait to collect
 * more items after receiving the last message. Default is 200ms.
 * @returns {object} An object containing the `addToBuffer` handler to push
 * items into the buffer and the `clearBuffer` hook to trigger a processing and
 * clearing of the buffer manually.
